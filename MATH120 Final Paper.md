# California Water Quality Analysis Using DWR Monitoring Data

The purpose of this project was to explore how water quality measurements vary between monitoring stations across California and whether those measurements show noticeable patterns over time. Instead of determining whether water quality is strictly “good” or “bad,” the focus was on comparing stations relative to one another and identifying general trends. This topic matters because water quality monitoring produces extremely large datasets, and being able to summarize and interpret that information is important for understanding environmental conditions at a broader scale. The data used in this project comes from the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) and includes water quality measurements collected from stations throughout the state over several decades. Because the full dataset contains millions of entries, the analysis focuses on a manageable subset while preserving the structure of the original data. Three commonly measured parameters were chosen for analysis: pH, dissolved oxygen, and electrical conductance. These parameters provide insight into chemical balance, oxygen availability, and dissolved mineral content in water, and class techniques were used to analyze how these attributes vary across stations.

The analysis began by loading two raw datasets from DWR: a stations dataset containing metadata and a field results dataset containing individual water quality measurements. Since the field results dataset was very large, a representative sample was used to keep the analysis computationally manageable and practical to store on GitHub. The datasets were merged using a shared station identifier so that each measurement could be analyzed alongside its corresponding station information. Data cleaning involved converting measurement values to numeric form, parsing dates into a datetime format, and filtering the dataset to include only pH, dissolved oxygen, and electrical conductance. Filtering was also used to focus on stations with sufficient data to allow meaningful comparisons. Average values by station were calculated to compare typical conditions across locations. Time-series line plots were created by grouping measurements by year for well-sampled stations, and correlation analysis was used to explore whether any of the parameters tended to move together.

Comparing average values across stations showed clear differences in water quality measurements depending on location. Some stations consistently had higher or lower average values for parameters like pH and dissolved oxygen, suggesting that local environmental conditions play a role in shaping water quality. These averages provided a useful summary without relying on individual sample readings. Time-series plots showed that yearly averages at frequently sampled stations tended to remain mostly stable over time. Dissolved oxygen levels showed some variation but no major long-term shifts, which suggests that conditions at these stations are generally consistent rather than rapidly changing. Correlation analysis revealed mostly weak relationships between parameters, with a moderate positive relationship between electrical conductance and pH, while dissolved oxygen appeared largely independent of the other two. Overall, these results suggest that while water quality varies by location, the measurements analyzed do not indicate extreme or unstable conditions at the stations examined.

Overall, the results suggest that water quality conditions vary across monitoring stations, but many measurements remain relatively consistent over time at specific locations. One strength of this project is its focus on relative comparison rather than strict classification, which avoids overinterpreting the data and better fits the limitations of the dataset. Managing the size of the data and maintaining reproducibility were challenges early on, but these were addressed by organizing raw and cleaned data within the project repository. A limitation of the analysis is that only three parameters were examined and spatial relationships were not explored. Additionally, the results should not be interpreted as definitive assessments of water safety, since the analysis is descriptive. With more time, future work could include additional parameters, spatial analysis, or separate comparisons of groundwater and surface water stations.

This project used California DWR water quality data to compare measurements across monitoring stations and examine trends over time. By focusing on relative differences and simple visualizations, the analysis demonstrates how large environmental datasets can be cleaned, organized, and interpreted effectively. The final workflow emphasizes clarity, reproducibility, and realistic data handling.
