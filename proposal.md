Final Project Proposal — California Water Quality Data
For my final project, I am analyzing a portion of the California Department of Water Resources Water Quality dataset. The full dataset contains over 4.6 million measurements, so I will be working with a smaller filtered section that is manageable and can be analyzed using the tools we learned in class. My goal is to explore how water quality varies across locations in California and how certain measurements change over time.
Project Focus
I will use Pandas to clean and filter the dataset, look at trends in specific water quality parameters, and create simple visualizations. The project stays entirely within class material: filtering, groupby operations, merges, descriptive statistics, and Plotly charts.
Research Questions
These are the specific questions I plan to answer:
Which stations have the highest and lowest average values for selected water quality parameters?
Example parameters: pH, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity.
How do these measurements change over time at individual stations or in a region?
Using date filtering and line plots.
Which stations collect the most samples, and how has sampling effort changed over time?
Using groupby + count.
Do any parameters tend to vary together or show similar patterns?
Using merges and basic correlation analysis.
Methods
I will use the following techniques:
Data cleaning and filtering with Pandas
Converting date fields and selecting relevant columns
groupby and agg for summary statistics
Merging datasets when needed
Visualizing findings using Plotly (line charts, bar charts, histograms)
Why This Project Works
The dataset is large, but filtering it makes it easy to handle while still providing interesting real-world insights. All analysis will rely on tools from the course, and the questions can be answered clearly using straightforward Python code.
