# California Water Quality Analysis  

## Project Overview
This project analyzes California’s statewide **Discrete Water Quality** dataset from the Department of Water Resources (DWR). The dataset contains over 4.6 million measurements collected from monitoring stations across the state. My goal is to clean and explore a workable subset of this huge dataset and create visualizations and summaries that help show how different water-quality parameters vary across regions, stations, and water-year types. All analysis uses Python tools we learned this semester, including Pandas, groupby, filtering, and Plotly.
